# SYNCANNON
Syncannon is a GUI interface that allows you to run wifi attacks in python. This GUI interface does all the work for the hacker -- all the hacker has to do is enter the ip and port to attack, and kivy automates the rest.

before running the script, make sure to read the readme. this readme explains a lot of issues you may run into during the workings of this projet.

To run the script, navigate to the directory you installed the application in, this is usually in the downloads directory. ('cd downloads')
then type ('sudo python3 SYNcannon.py')

#NOTE: in order to run this script, you must first have the kivy and scapy modules installed on your computer first.
to install kivy, type in your shell ("sudo pip3 install kivy")
to install scapy, type in your linux shell ("sudo pip3 install scapy")
